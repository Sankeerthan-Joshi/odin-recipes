    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pierogi are one of the most recognizable Polish foods. Pierogi is actually the plural form of the word pier√≥g, a generic term for filled dumplings. These half circular dumplings are made from unleavened dough and are stuffed with fillings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling:</h4>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>4 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>5 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For Each Serving:</h4>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>Minced fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, combine flour and salt; cover and pulse to blend. Add water, eggs and butter; cover and pulse until dough forms a ball, adding an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed. Let rest, covered, 15 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until tender, 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute onions in butter until tender.</li>
        <li>Drain potatoes. Over very low heat, stir potatoes until steam has evaporated, 1-2 minutes. Press through a potato ricer or strainer into a large bowl. Stir in cream cheese, salt, pepper and onion mixture.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 4 parts. On a lightly floured surface, roll 1 portion of dough to 1/8-in. thickness; cut with a floured 3-in. biscuit cutter. Place 2 teaspoons of filling in center of each circle. Moisten edges with water; fold in half and press edges to seal. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
        <li>Bring a Dutch oven of water to a boil over high heat; add pierogi in batches. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer; cook until pierogi float to the top and are tender, 1-2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon. In a large skillet, saute 4 pierogi and onion in butter until pierogi are lightly browned and heated through; sprinkle with parsley. Repeat with remaining pierogi.</li>
    </ol>
